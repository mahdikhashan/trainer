## Overview

Kubeflow Trainer is a Kubernetes-native project designed for large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuning and enabling scalable, distributed training of machine learning (ML) models across
various frameworks, including PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, and others.

You can integrate other ML libraries such as [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co),
[DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed), or [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM)
with Kubeflow Trainer to run them on Kubernetes.

Kubeflow Trainer enables you to effortlessly develop your LLMs with the
[Kubeflow Python SDK](https://github.com/kubeflow/sdk/), and build Kubernetes-native Training
Runtimes using Kubernetes Custom Resource APIs.

## Acknowledgement

This project was originally started as a distributed training operator for TensorFlow and later we
merged efforts from other Kubeflow Training Operators to provide a unified and simplified experience
for both users and developers. We are very grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them,
asked and answered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions.
We'd also like to thank everyone who's contributed to and maintained the original operators.
